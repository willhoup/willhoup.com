title: 2021 reading list
date: January 8, 2021

At the start of 2017, I made a list of books I wanted to read for several years but never had. There were some real bangers in the 20-odd titles (and real duds), but I read them all. It was the first time in a while that I had stuck with a New Year's resolution – basically out of spite since having an uncomfortable, public-shaming moment with a start-of-the-year change at the age of 12.

It's not like this resolution was difficult; reading is fun even without a library card. The list did accomplish a couple of things, though. Namely, it push me out of my normie vein of literary fiction. And while it was challenging to stay disciplined through like a million words (i.e. video games are a lot easier to consume than pages), I feel like the seeds I started to sow were focused on intentionality. 2020 has now brought that into stark relief for me.

Even the concept of time has had to run the gauntlet for a few laps this pandemic. On top of the obvious global health crisis, [being a new dad](https://www.instagram.com/p/B78aOM2HmY-/) puts a serious emphasis on my time management. (being a new dad is freaking awesome btw).

Honestly my main goal in 2021 is to be deliberate in how I spend my waking hours with my family – no matter anything I lay out here, that's where my heart's at. I want to focus on my wife and son and limit any distractions (e.g. lingering on work thoughts or playing dumb games on my phone).

With this on my mind, I like the idea of returning to something that outlines things I want to or could do. I plan on taking this beyond just a reading list, but for those keeping up, here are my books for the new year.

### 2021 reading list\*

- #### The Storm Before the Storm – Mike Duncan

  I loved [The History of Rome](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/) podcast. Duncan has an incredible grasp on Rome's history and political players big and small. Excited to read this book (cheating a little by starting it in late December).

- #### Lord of the Rings trilogy – JRR Tolkien

  I thought I had read these when the movies came out ... but turns out I hadn't. I recently re-watched the trilogy and decided its time to read them.

- #### Rage – Bob Woodward

  Finished _Fear_ by Woodward in November. Very interesting reporting although I would say Woodward isn't the best wordsmith. Thought this too about _All The President's Men_. An incredible story of fact-finding not incredibly told.

- #### Empires, Nations, and Families – Anne Hyde

  I like to peruse the Pulitzer winner/finalists lists for history as well as fiction and choose things to read. I love books on the American West, and this looked right up my alley.

- #### Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire – David Remnick

  Besides a few [Hardcore History](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/) episodes on the Cold War, I haven't read, listened, or seen much on this time period.

- #### The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery – Eric Foner

  In the past three years, I've read dozens of books on the Civil War – on military tactics, political currents, cultural touchpoints – but Foner's book has slipped through the cracks. Now it's time.

- #### Liberation Trilogy – Rick Atkinson

  My dad has recently turned into a military history buff and wants me to check this series out. _An Army at Dawn_ won the Pulitzer. I've listened to a lot more WWII history than read it, so I'm excited to give this a go.

- #### War and Peace - Leo Tolstoy

  I was expelled from my high school my junior year (long story) just in time to miss out on a lot of the classics in English literature class. I've slowly been trying to play catch-up in the past decade.

- #### The Lost World of the Israelite Conquest: Covenant, Retribution, and the Fate of the Canaanites – John H. Walton

  I read Walton's first two _Lost World_ pieces and found them very helpful in putting the Old Testament in context as well as setting the scene for ancient literature and culture.

  God-ordained violence in the Old Testament has been one of the hardest things for me to square in scripture. I have a lot of thoughts and have had many discussions on this and still have lingering questions. Trying to re-contexualize the writing in its time and for its purpose is difficult and stepping out of my 21st century frame can feel almost impossible.

  In _The Lost World of Genesis One_, Walton was very helpful in framing and defining scripture and the world around it. I'm hoping for some enlightened thoughts in this one as

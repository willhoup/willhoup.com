# willhoup.com

This repo holds the different folders and files that I've used along the years to create http://willhoup.com. I've found it incredibly valuable to iterate on this site through the years and test out new frameworks and code (for better or for worse). Right now the site (which is incredibly simple) is using [next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
